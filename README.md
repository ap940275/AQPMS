# Abstract:-
This paper deals with measuring Air Quality using MQ135 sensor along with Carbon Monoxide CO
using MQ7 sensor. Measuring Air Quality is an important element for bringing lot of awareness in
the people to take care of the future generations a healthier life. We are trying to implement the
system using IOT platforms like Blynk we can bring awareness to every individual about the harm
we are doing to our environment. Already, New Delhi is remarked as the most pollution city in the
world recording Air Quality above 300PPM. We have used easiest platform like Blynk and set the
dashboard to public such that everyone can come to know the Air Quality at the location where the
system is installed.




# AQPMS
From all the above information provided, we are able to calculate Air Quality in PPM. The MQ135 sensor is to detect CO, CO2, NH4 etc. So, just to tell the individual gases level particularly, we have used CO (Carbon Monoxide) MQ7 sensor. This project can be used both for indoor as well as outdoor. For indoor, we can make this kit as a compact device such that if every home started using the device, we can monitor the indoor air quality of a particular targeted area. We can use one more sensor that tells the ozone layer status. Also we can use PM2.5 laser dust sensor helpful for exclusively for vehicle and factory emissions sensing.It supports the new technology and effectively supports the healthy life concept.This system has features for the people to monitor the amount of pollution on their mobile phones using the application.
